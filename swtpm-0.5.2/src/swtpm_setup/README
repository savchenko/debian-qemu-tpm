swtpm_setup is a tool that simulates the manufacturing of a TPM
and allows a user to prepare the initial state of a TPM by having
the TPM create an EK, creating the EK and platform certificates for it,
and saving the certificates into the NVRAM of the TPM before it is used
for the first time.

For further information, check the manpage 'man swtpm_setup'.
